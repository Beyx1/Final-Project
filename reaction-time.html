            <h1>Defining Reaction Time</h1>
            <p>Reaction time is how fast you are able to quickly act to an approaching action that is flying towards you. A simple example would be when trying to slap a flying bug moving at a blink of an eye and hitting that fly the instant it comes into vision. Everyone has different forms of reaction times whether it's fast or slow.</p>
            
            <h1>Reaction Time in Physical Sports</h1>

            <p>In sports like Soccar and Hockey the goalkeepers goal is to prevent their side of the goal to be scored on from the opposing team. In moments when someone either kicks the soccar ball really hard, making the ball go flying or hits a hocky puck really fast into a teams goal, primarlly, the goalkeeper must be quick enough to process how fast the object is coming in contact to their goal along with the direction the object is flying to and immedietly prevent the soccar ball or hocky puck from getting into their goal.</p>

            <p>In genres such as first person shooter or fighting games, having a good grasp of being able to act quicky upon a fast action is very important in competition as it allows you as the player to clutch out moments where you are the remaining player that is up against five other players if playing in a team based game. When in team-based games, if you are the remaining player, the atmosphere becomes silent and any action you see in vision sends a signal to your brain to immediatly act upon action.</p>

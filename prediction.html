            <h1>Defining Prediction</h1>
            <p>Prediction can be defined as knowing when someone is going to preform an action before even pulling it off. Once you know that action is going to be telegraphed, a little sketch blossoms into your head to counter that action with an action that beats it. Sometimes predicting an action can go as deep as layering actions or thought processes on top of eachother, making every action cancel eachother out.</p>

            <p>Prediction can be seen in Boxing as it not only takes brute streangh to be competent in the sport, but being one step ahead of your opponent is equally important. Knowing which fist your opponent is gonna swing at you along with whether they are going to aim high or low, either your face or chest, in order to knock you down. If you anticipate where you opponent is going to hit you, you would either block the attack from coming in, evading the attack completly, or even countering with a faster, hard hitting attack to outspeed your opponent's attack.</p>

            <p>Much like in boxing, traditional fighting games settle in one on one fights where the goal is to defeat your opponent by completly knocking your opponent down by either hitting or blocking your opponent's high or low attacks. However in most traditional fighting games the atmosphere is two-dimentional and can only move left of right along with dealing with those who throw fireballs and preform uppercuts that indulge flames coming out of their arms for visual effect. Additionally, player's can knock down their opponents which forces them to not be able to move for a couple of seconds to reset a player's position & push than towards the corner of the screen to apply pressure and preform different actions as you wake up.</p>
            
            <p>The most common examples of actions a player can pull off are:</p>
            
            <h1>Punishing with a grab</h1>

            <h1>Preform a combo to lower your health</h1>
            
            <img src="images/Punish-with-combo.gif" alt="Street-Fighter-Third-Strike" width=700px>
            
            <h1>Preforming a super move for maximum damage</h1>
            
            <img src="images/Prediction-super.PNG" alt="Street-Fighter-Third-Strike" width=700px>
            
            <p>There are ways to prevent yourself from becoming a punching bag in fighting games as a majority of them follow a rock, paper, scissors cycle which forces players to anticipate what thier opponent is going to preform and quickly think of a way to counter them from preforming that action. </p>
            
            <p>This cycle follows through with punches, blocking, and grabs. Each factor beats another while looses against the other. For exampleL</p>
            
            <h1>Grabs beats blocking</h1>
            
            <img src="images/grab-beats-block.gif" alt="Street-Fighter-Third-Strike" width=700px>
            
            <h1>Blocking beats attacks</h1>

            <p>Knowing what your opponent is anticipating to preform grnats you an upper hand when knowing this concept in fighting games.</p>

            <h1>Defining Strategics</h1>
            <p>Strategics is pretty much strategy. An element that is used in both indepentent and team-based games, but it's highlighted mostly in team-based games as every player on a team serves a purpose, a personal goal that every member is trying to acomplish. With strategy, players formulate a plan to adapt to a disadvantaging situation in order to control the game, advancing to win. </p>

            <p>In a sport like American Football, there are different plans or how it's properly called, formations, that are used despending on a situation. There is a offensive and defencive formation that are used depending on how close or far the football is to the goal. Notice that the defence formation is spread out around the field to cover more ground unlike the offense formation.</p>
            
            <h1>Strategics in Video Games</h1>
            
            <p>Mainly in class-based first person shooters, each player plays a unique role that contribules to the team in order to win a consecutive amount of rounds. Some of these roles would include a offensive, glass cannon character that does large amounts of damage but can be taken out easily, a tank who is slow but can withstand taking a lot of damage, and a support who can heal injured teammates.</p>

            <p>As shown on the visual, the support class would most likely hide behind any large terrain or areas where they can safely heal their teammates when rotating back to the healer. If the healer is dead, it makes the rest of the team more likely to be eliminated as they are not able to get healed.</p>
